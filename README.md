# MAESTRO

*a low Mach number stellar hydrodynamics code*

`Maestro` solves the equations of low Mach number hydrodynamics for
stratified atmospheres/stars with a general equation of state.  It
includes reactions and thermal diffusion and can be used on anything
from a single core to 100,000s of processor cores with MPI + OpenMP.

A description of the algorithm and links to the algorithm papers can
be found here:

A *Getting Started* guide is provided in the Maestro User's Guide.  To
build the User's Guide, cd into `Docs/`, and type `make`, or download
