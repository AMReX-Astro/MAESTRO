<P>A large number of interesting astrophysical phenomena occur at low
Mach numbers.  Evolving these flows with a fully compressible
simulation code is inefficient, because of the need to follow the
sound waves.  For an explicit time-discretization (i.e., the new state
is expressed solely in terms of the present state), a fundamental
limitation exists on the size of the allowable timesteps -- the CFL
condition.  A timestep is restricted such that information may only
propagate across one zone in the computational grid per timestep.  In
compressible flow, information propagates at the speeds: u, <nobr>u +
c</nobr>, and
<nobr>u - c</nobr>, where c is the sound speed.
Mathematically the timestep restriction is expressed as
<div class="eq">&Delta; t < min { &Delta; x / (|u| + c) }</div>
For very low Mach number flows, this is
<div class="eq">&Delta; t ~ &Delta; x / c</div>
This means that <em>for an interface moving at a Mach number M << 1, 
it takes 1/M timesteps for that interface to move just one zone!</em>

<p>Maestro solves a reformulation of the equations of hydrodynamics
that filters out sound waves, while retaining the compressibility effects
important to the problem at hand.  This results in a timestep
constraint of the form
<div class="eq">&Delta; t < min{ &Delta; x / |u| }</div>
Therefore, Maestro requires far fewer timesteps (~1/M fewer) to 
simulate low Mach number flows.    

<p>Mathematically, we can think of low Mach number flows as exhibiting
instantaneous acoustic equilibriation.  Figure 1 shows this
graphically.  Three temperature perturbations were placed in a
stratified atmosphere, seeding nuclear reactions.  The heat release
makes the bubbles buoyant.  The top panel shows the Mach number for
the compressible solution&mdash;a clear signal resulting from the
finite propagation speed of the soundwaves is seen surrounding each
bubble.  In the low panel, a low Mach number method was used.  Owing
to the instantaneous acoustic equilibriation, the velocity field is
realized throughout the whole domain&mdash;even far from the bubbles.
However, the flow at the bubbles is identical between the two codes,
showing that in this case, the soundwaves are not imporatant to the
dynamics.

<p>Maestro was developed in a series of papers <a href="./papers/">listed
here</a>.

<p>Maestro is built on an adaptive mesh framework through the BoxLib
library and uses MPI and OpenMP for parallelization.
