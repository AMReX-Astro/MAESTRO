This directory contains the different equations of state that are
released with MAESTRO.  For more networks that work with both MAESTRO
and other BoxLib-based codes, check out the Microphysics repository at

gamma_law_general:

   A general gamma-law EOS.  This computes the mean molecular
   weight from the mass fractions and the species properties defined
   in the network module.  

   NOTE: the entropy is currently only correct for a monatomic gas
   (gamma = 5/3).  A more general expression (than the Sactur-Tetrode
   equation) is needed for an arbitrary constant-gamma gas.
