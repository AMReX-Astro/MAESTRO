This directory contains the different equations of state that are
released with MAESTRO:

1) gamma_law_general:

   A general gamma-law EOS.  This computes the mean molecular
   weight from the mass fractions and the species properties defined
   in the network module.  

   NOTE: the entropy is currently only correct for a monatomic gas
   (gamma = 5/3).  A more general expression (than the Sactur-Tetrode
   equation) is needed for an arbitrary constant-gamma gas.

2) helmeos:
   
   Frank Timmes' general stellar EOS.  This is modified from the
   publically available version (although the changes should not
   affect the results).  The major changes are related to
   thread-safety.  The common blocks no longer pass the state to/from
   the EOS, instead we use the argument list.
