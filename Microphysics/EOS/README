This directory contains the different equations of state that either
MAESTRO or CASTRO use (or both).

collapse:

   Adam Burrow's nuclear EOS for core-collapse supernova simulations


gamma_law_eos:

   the original CASTRO gamma-law EOS.  This should eventually be
   removed, as it does not really do anything physical for the
   temperature.


gamma_law_eos_abar:

   a hacked version of the gamma_law_eos.  It assumes a completely
   ionized solar composition, and gives a meaningful temperature as a
   result.


gamma_law_general:

   a new, general gamma-law EOS.  This computes the mean molecular
   weight from the mass fractions and the species properties defined
   in the network module.  Eventually, this should be the default (and
   only) gamma-law EOS.


helmeos:
   
   Frank Timmes' general stellar EOS.


hma_eos:

   Haito Ma's slighly tweaked version of the helmeos -- basically the
   helmeos with a table look up for abar.


lattimer_swesty:

   the Lattimer-Swesty nuclear EOS for core-collapse simulations


perfect_gas_with_rad:

   Candace Church Joggerst's EOS that implements an ideal gas (with 
   ionization) + radiation.
