This directory contains the different equations of state that either
MAESTRO or CASTRO use (or both).

EOSs with MAESTRO interfaces:

  -- helmeos
  -- gamma_law_general


Brief descriptions of the various EOSs:

collapse:

   Adam Burrow's nuclear EOS for core-collapse supernova simulations


gamma_law:

   a simple gamma-law EOS with a hard-coded composition.  It assumes a
   completely ionized solar composition, and gives a meaningful
   temperature as a result.


gamma_law_general:

   a new, general gamma-law EOS.  This computes the mean molecular
   weight from the mass fractions and the species properties defined
   in the network module.  Eventually, this should be the default (and
   only) gamma-law EOS.

   NOTE: the entropy is currently only correct for a monatomic gas
   (gamma = 5/3).  A more general expression (than the Sactur-Tetrode
   equation) is needed for an arbitrary constant-gamma gas.


helmeos:
   
   Frank Timmes' general stellar EOS.  This is modified from the
   publically available version (although the changes should not
   affect the results).  The major changes are related to
   thread-safety.  The common blocks no longer pass the state to/from
   the EOS, instead we use the argument list.

helmeos_without_rad:

   helmeos without radiation.  This is for radiation hydro simulations.
   Since radiation is included in the system already, we should take
   it out in EOS. 

lattimer_swesty:

   the Lattimer-Swesty nuclear EOS for core-collapse simulations

   NOTE: dpdr and dpde are both set to 0.  This will affect the use of
   source terms.


perfect_gas_with_rad:

   Candace Church Joggerst's EOS that implements an ideal gas (with 
   ionization) + radiation.

   NOTE: dpdr was originally not set correctly in this EOS.  This will
   affect the use of source terms.  There is a new version of the EOS
   in use now, new_eos.f90.  It has not been evaluated.
