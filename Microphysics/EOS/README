This directory contains the simple gamma_law_general equation of 
state that models an ideal gas as a gamma-law (p = (gamma-1) rho e).

Additional equations of state are available in the Microphysics git
repo.

   gamma_law_general:

   A general gamma-law EOS.  This computes the mean molecular
   weight from the mass fractions and the species properties defined
   in the network module.  

   NOTE: the entropy is currently only correct for a monatomic gas
   (gamma = 5/3).  A more general expression (than the Sactur-Tetrode
   equation) is needed for an arbitrary constant-gamma gas.
