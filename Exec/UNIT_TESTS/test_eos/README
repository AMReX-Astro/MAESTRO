This test problem creates a grid of rho, T, and X and calls the EOS.
Various quantities are output to a plotfile.  Then we invert the EOS
and make sure we recover the temperature again.

This test uses only a small set of the MAESTRO routines.  It is setup
as a UNIT_TEST in the GNUmakefile.  The GPackage.mak in this directory
picks the few MAESTRO files we need.  There is a custom variables
module that defines a different set of the quantities than normally
used.
