+Introduction
-------------------------
xinGen.py is a basic python script used to generate mass fraction input files
for the test_react unit test.

+Usage
-------------------------
There are two basic ways to make use of xinGen:

1) Interactive:
     Simply execute './xinGen.py' in a terminal and answer the given prompts.
     The prompts are as follows:
        -How many species are in the network?
        -What is the grid size?
        -For each species:
          -Select a mass fraction type
            -Type A --> This species will have a uniform (the same for all cells) 
                        solar hydrogen value
            -Type B --> This species will have a uniform solar helium value
            -Type C --> This species will have a uniform solar metallicity value
            -Type D --> The user will be asked to provide a custom uniform value
            -Type E --> The user will be asked to provide an initial value (the 
                        mass fraction at cell 0) and a delta (a +/- value to be 
                        added to the mass fraction for each subsequent cell) 

2) File input:
     To avoid the rather cumbersome answering of prompts, one can write a file
     with the desired answers to the prompts and pipe it in.

     For example, execute 'cat xinInput | ./xinGen.py' in a terminal where the
     file 'xinInput' contains:
     ---
     3
     64
     a
     b
     c 
     ---

+Output
-------------------------
The output file generated, 'xin', is very basic.  Each line contains data for
one species (line 1 is species 1, line 2 species 2, etc...).  On each line
are X data points where X is the grid size. 

So, for example, the 5th data point on line 3 represents the mass fraction
of species 3 at the 5th cell of the Z axis of the 3D grid (in test_react, 
temperature is varied along one axis, density the other, and mass fraction
the last).
