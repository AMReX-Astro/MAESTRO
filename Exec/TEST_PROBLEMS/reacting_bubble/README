test2 is a bubble rise problem in plane-parallel which was originally
used in paper III.  The equivalent FLASH setup is lmn_bubble_burn.

The initial models were originally generated by the FLASH setup, but
can also be equivalently generated with MAESTRO/initial_models/test2/

The adaptive inputs files originally lived in
MAESTRO_Exec/TEST_PROBLEMS/test2_adaptive/.  Now it relies on
use_tpert_in_tagging=T to pass tpert into the tagging routine in
the aux_tag_mf multifab in the argument list.
