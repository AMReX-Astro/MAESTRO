The gamma_law_bubble problem initializes a non-reacting bubble in a
isothermal gamma-law gas atmosphere.  

For an ideal gas, in hydrostatic equilibrium, the density obeys:

dp/dr = d(rho k T / (mu m_p) ) / dr = - rho g

if T = const (isothermal), then

k T / (mu m_p) d rho / dr = - rho g

The pressure scale height can be identified as

H = k T / (mu m_p g) = p / (rho g)

and the density is

rho = rho_0 exp(-r/H)


In order to get a bubble rising at an M ~ 0.1, we need to have
stratification.  This is because the sound speed for an ideal gas is

c_s = sqrt(gamma p / rho)

A bubble rises with a speed 

v ~ sqrt( A g R)

where A is the Atwood number and R is the bubble radius.

Therefore, the Mach number of the bubble rise is

M = v/c_s = sqrt( A g R / (gamma p / rho) ) ~ sqrt(R/H)

So, for the bubble to rise at a reasonable Mach number, we need R ~ H.
