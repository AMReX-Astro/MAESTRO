! inlet_bc_module is a simple container module that holds the parameters
! that are used by physbc to implement the inlet boundary conditions.
! As these are problem-specific, any problem needing inlet boundary 
! conditions should create its own version of this module, using this
! outline.

module inlet_bc_module

  use bl_types
  use bl_constants_module
  use bl_space
  use network
  use eos_module, only: eos, eos_input_rp
  use eos_type_module

  implicit none

  ! parameters that would be used by physbc in the EXT_DIR sections
  ! would be stored here with the 'save' attribute
  real(dp_t), save :: INLET_RHO
  real(dp_t), save :: INLET_RHOH
  real(dp_t), save :: INLET_TEMP
  real(dp_t), save :: INLET_CS

  ! here we would initialize the parameters that are module variables.

  ! and upon restart, just after the base state is read in.
