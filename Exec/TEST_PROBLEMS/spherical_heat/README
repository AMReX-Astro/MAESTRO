This is 3D version of test_basestate. It tests base-state expansion with a 
spherically symmetric analytic heating term.

prob_type 1 is for a full white-dwarf environment.  We have a gaussian bump 
of heating at the center of the star, and a null reaction network.

prob_type 2 is for hydrogen core convection with an analytic expression for 
the CNO cycle

Note: Several tweaks are used in the code to force Utilde=0.  These are needed 
because "X - Avg(X)" should be ZERO, but isn't due to roundoff.  These tweaks 
are:

In subroutne make_hgrhs_3d, rhs=0.d0

In subroutine make_macrhs_3d_sphr, rhs=0.d0

In subroutine mk_vel_force_3d_sphr, rhopert = 0.d0

In subroutine add_w0_force_3d_sphr, the w0_force contribution is commented out
