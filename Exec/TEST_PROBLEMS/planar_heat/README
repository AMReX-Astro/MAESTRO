This is a test problem for base-state expansion in a 2D white-dwarf environment.
We have a gaussinan bump of heating near the bottom, and a null reaction network.

In order to make this run in 1D properly, several tweaks need to be added to the code
to fix for numerical noise coming from the fact that "X - Avg(X)" should be ZERO,
but isn't due to roundoff.
