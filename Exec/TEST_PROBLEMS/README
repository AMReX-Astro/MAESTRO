incomp_shear_jet/

  A simple pure-incompressible shear layer problem.  This is the 
  example problem used in Bell, Colella, and Glaz (1989).


nersc_benchmark/


rt/

  A classic Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem.


test2/
 
  The test problem from the Maestro paper III.  This places 3 hots
  spots in a plane-parallel atmosphere.  Burning makes these bubbles
  buoyant, and then roll up.

  This also contains the inputs files used in the multilevel Maestro
  paper to show adaptivity in the test2 problem.  


test_convect/

  Drive convection through a plane-parallel atmosphere using an
  externally-specified heat source.  This problem was used to compare
  with compressible solvers in Maestro paper III and to test the
  multilevel algorithm in the multilevel paper.
