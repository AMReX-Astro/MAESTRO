Here, we are modifying the momentum equation in order to hopefully conserve energy instead of pseudo-energy.  This amounts to replacing -grad(pi) in the momentum equation with -beta*grad(pi).  To implement this in MAESTRO, we make the following changes.  Instead of solving

div( (beta/rho)*grad(phi) ) = div( beta*u )

for phi, we will solve

div( (beta^2/rho*grad(phi) ) = div( beta*u )

for phi.  Then to update u, we use

u = u + (beta/rho)*grad(phi).

Another change is in the definition of gpi, where formally gpi=grad(pi).  Since the term in the momentum equation is now -beta*grad(pi), we define

gpi = beta*grad(pi)

in step 11 of the timestep.
