Based on Alex's Kepler files, the region between r = [7072.5,8287.2]
should be convectively unstable.

These model files were calculated using
AstroDev/initial_models/xrb/alex_models/mixed_h_he/init_1d.f90 with
the following command line options:

--model_file 1000_rprox.raw 
-xmin 6499.5 
-xmax 8803.5 
-isen 7072.49 8287.17 
-ldc 1.0

plus the -nx option for the resolution.
