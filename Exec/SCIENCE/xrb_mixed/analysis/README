- plotDiag.py

  This looks for the xrb*diag.out files and makes plots of the
  quantities vs. time.  Only those quantities described in the
  labelDict will be plotted.


- specMass.py

  This uses the
  AmrPostprocessing/F_Src/MAESTRO_xrb/fspec_total_mass.f90 routine to
  plot the total mass of each species as a function of time.  This
  first calls fspec_total_mass on all the plt* files in the current
  directory, then builds a numpy array, saves that array to disk in
  "masses.txt", and then makes a single plot of the evolution of the
  total masses.  If you pass the --just-plot flag to the routine, it
  will only read data from the "masses.txt" file instead of rebuilding
  it.  Passing the "--append" flag will not overwrite the previous
  masses.txt file, but rather append to it.  The "--every <int>" flag
  can be specified to calculate the total mass of only some of the
  plt* files in the current working directory.  NOTE: you need to have
  fspec_total_mass compiled and in the current directory.


- plotxrball.py

  This script uses the AmrPostprocessing/python/fsnapshot.so build
  (see the Makefile there) to parse several variables from a plotfile
  and generate colormap plots.  The limits an variables are all
  hard-coded and need to be modified if you want something different.
  NOTE: this requires you to have fsnapshot.so built in a place python
  can find it.
