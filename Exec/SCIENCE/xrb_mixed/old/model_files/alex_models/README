All of tehse files were generated with the following default options
to init_1d.f90:

xmin               = ZERO
xmax               = 9e3_dp_t
phi                = 3e0_dp_t
low_density_cutoff = 1.d-4

For the *5.7e8* and *approx8* models, we specified a smoothing length via the
--len_smooth command argument:

smoothing_length   = 25.0e0
