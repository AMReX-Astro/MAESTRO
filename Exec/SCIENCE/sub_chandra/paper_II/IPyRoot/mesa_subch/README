This directory contains the code used to generate rates as plotted in the sub-Ch II paper.
This is MESA code, using version 7503.  Note that the MESASDK for this version
must be initialized for the `make` command to work.  You will also need to modify the
my_mesa_dir variable in src/mod_test_net.f to point to your own installation of MESA.

Each executable of the form t#rhoX.X calculates rates for the network described in 
data/sub_chandra.net at a temperature of #00 MK and a density of 10^X.X.

Note that a lightly modified version of mesa/net/private/net_derivs.f90 is used to
get energy generation on a per reaction basis (instead of the bulk information
that's provided by default).  This can be found here in src/.

This code is based on test_net.f found in mesa/net/test/.
