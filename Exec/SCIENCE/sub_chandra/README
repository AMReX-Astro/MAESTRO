This directory contains files and sub-directories relevant to our study of explosive convection
in a helium shell enveloping a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf.  Such burning establishes
the conditions for various interesting phenomenon including double detonation type Ia 
supernovae, helium novae, and ".Ia"'s (only the shell explodes, with a brightness of about a
tenth that of a SNe Ia).
