toy_convect/

   A nova-like problem for studying convection.  This problem has seen
   extensive use in understanding which prediction types are the best
   when we have sharp species gradients.  See Mike Z or Ryan for
   details.

   Model convection leading up to ignition in the Chandraseskhar-mass
   SNe Ia progenitor model.  This setup was the basis for Zingale et
   al. 2009 (ApJ, 704, 196), Zingale et al. 2011 (ApJ, 740, 8), and
   Nonaka et al. 2012 (ApJ, 745, 73).
