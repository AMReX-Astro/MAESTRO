flame/

   A combustion-mode problem where we model a thermonuclear flame in a
   small domain.  This enforces the low Mach combustion constraint
   div{U} = S.  Hot ash and cool fuel are put into contact and a flame
   will ignite and propagate across the grid.  Inflow boundary
   conditions are used to allow for an inflow velocity to be set to
   keep the laminar flame stationary.

toy_convect/

   A nova-like problem for studying convection.  This problem has seen
   extensive use in understanding which prediction types are the best
   when we have sharp species gradients.  See Mike Z or Ryan for
   details.


wdconvect/

   Model convection leading up to ignition in the Chandraseskhar-mass
   SNe Ia progenitor model.  This setup was the basis for Zingale et
   al. 2009 (ApJ, 704, 196), Zingale et al. 2011 (ApJ, 740, 8), and
   Nonaka et al. 2012 (ApJ, 745, 73).
