Models generated using new (2009-08-27) Kepler data from Stan

generated from AstroDev/initial_models/kepler_hybrid

Note: the Kepler initial model was ~ 0.5 C, 0.5 O with small,
O(1.e-3), amounts of Ne20 and smaller, O(1.e-5), amounts of Mg24. We
merge those to species together and call them 'ash'.  This changes
the composition very slightly.
