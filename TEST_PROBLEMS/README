incomp_shear_jet/

  A simple pure-incompressible shear layer problem.  This is the 
  example problem used in Bell, Colella, and Glaz (1989).


nersc_benchmark/


test2/
 
  The test problem from the Maestro paper III.  This places 3 hots
  spots in a plane-parallel atmosphere.  Burning makes these bubbles
  buoyant, and then roll up.


test_convect/

  Drive convection through a plane-parallel atmosphere using an
  externally-specified heat source.  This problem was used to compare
  with compressible solvers in Maestro paper III and to test the
  multilevel algorithm in the multilevel paper.
