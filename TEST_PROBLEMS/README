gamma_law_bubble/
  
  A simple rising bubble in a stratified atmosphere, using the
  gamma-law equation of state.  The bubble is initialized via a
  temperature perturbation---no heating term is used.  By varying the
  amplitude of the perturbation, the Mach number of the bubble
  changes.  The atmosphere can be setup to be isentropic or
  isothermal.


gamma_law_bubble_interface/

  Similar to gamma_law_bubble, but now the atmosphere consists of
  two parts.  The lower layer is isentropic.  The upper layer is
  either isentropic or isothermal.  A jump in entropy can be 
  applied at the interface, creating an entropy "wall" that stops
  the bubble.


incomp_shear_jet/

  A simple pure-incompressible shear layer problem.  This is the 
  example problem used in Bell, Colella, and Glaz (1989).


mach_bubble/

  Similar to gamma_law_bubble, but this uses a heating term to seed
  the bubbles.


mach_jet/

  Inflow a low Mach number jet through the lower boundary into a
  constant density/p domain.  This was used to explore acoustics and
  the role of pi in the overall pressure in the SciDAC 2010 paper
  (http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2801)

  A classic Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem.


spherical_heat/

  Map a spherical star (a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf) onto the
  Cartesian domain and uses an external heat source to cause the star
  to expand.  This is the 3D analogue of the
  UNIT_TESTS/test_basestate.  This problem was discussed in
  the multilevel paper.

test2/
 
  The test problem from the Maestro paper III.  This places 3 hots
  spots in a plane-parallel atmosphere.  Burning makes these bubbles
  buoyant, and then roll up.


test2_adaptive/

  A version of test2 with adaptive grids, used in the multilevel
  paper.

test_convect/

  Drive convection through a plane-parallel atmosphere using an
  externally-specified heat source.  This problem was used to compare
  with compressible solvers in Maestro paper III and to test the
  multilevel algorithm in the multilevel paper.

test_spherical/

   Set up an isentropically stratified star and stir it up with a
   random velocity field.  The low Mach number constraint is replaced
   with the anelastic constraint (through the beta_type runtime
   parameter).  Analytically, under these conditions, the density of
   the star should not change.  This test problem was discussed in
   Maestro paper IV.
