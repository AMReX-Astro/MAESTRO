Machine: jaguar phase 3 upgrade to Titan - XK6 interlagos architecture

Each run performed with the following options to aprun: -S 1 -d 8

Description of files/directories:

  mods.txt: 
    A `module list` at the time of compilation.

  output_*: 
    Directories containing the diag output files for each of
    the nersc_benchmark test problems.

  timing-info.txt:

    Compilation of all the runtime information for each of the
    nersc_benchmark test problems.  The table columns are: job name,
    total time, time for first step, and average of remaining steps (2
    through 10).  The total time is taken from the sum of the "Time to
    advance timestep" numbers, not the total runtime listed at the end
    of the output.  Timing information gathered using this script:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

awk 'BEGIN{sum=0.0;step=0}; 
/advance timestep/ {step=step+1; sum=sum+$5; if(step==1) {first=$5};}
/Run Time/ {total=$4}
 END{print total, first, (sum-first)/(step-1)}' $1
