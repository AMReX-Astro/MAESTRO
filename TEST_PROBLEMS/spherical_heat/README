This is a test problem for base-state expansion in a full white-dwarf environment.
We have a gaussinan bump of heating near the center of the star, and a null reaction network.
This is essentially a 3D version

In order to make this run in 1D properly, several tweaks need to be added to the code
to fix for numerical noise coming from the fact that "X - Avg(X)" should be ZERO,
but isn't due to roundoff.

In subroutne make_hgrhs_3d, set rhs=0.d0

In subroutine make_macrhs_3d_sphr, set rhs=0.d0

In subroutine mk_vel_force_3d_sphr, set rhopert = 0.d0

In subroutine add_w0_force_3d_sphr, comment out the w0_force contribution
