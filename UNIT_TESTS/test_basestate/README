An attempt to do just the 1-d base state expansion using the 
same routines as the main code.  This is effectively the oned_test
routines reimplemented to use the main Maestro code.

The initial model for the spherical case was created with FLASH using
the lmn_head_isentropic_1d_spherical test problem.  The compressible
solution is stored in compressible-1.e16-t=10.00.out.  The initial
model and compressible output were run with Coulomb corrections
enabled.
