spherical test problem from multilevel paper:

  inputs-spherical_heat is the inputs file
 
  This is a test problem for base-state expansion in a full
  white-dwarf environment.  We have a gaussinan bump of heating at the
  center of the star, and a null reaction network.

  This is a 1D version of spherical_heat.

  Castro output is:

    castro_2sec_den
    castro_2sec_pres
    castro_2sec_temp

  run with the hydrostatic_adjust Castro setup.



plane-parallel test problem:

  inputs-planar approximates what was done in paper II, but this
  should be revisited.
