test_advect is a simple test of the advection scheme only.  In short
we:

-- set up a unit cube (or equivalent in lower dimensions) with 
   periodic boundaries

-- initialize a constant velocity field in one of the coordinate
   directions

-- initialize the density field to a gaussian

-- estimate a timestep

-- use density_advance to update the density field only.
