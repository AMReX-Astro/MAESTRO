This problem is designed to test the solver used in the conduction
step of the main algorithm.

We set up a 2d Gaussian temperature pulse and wish to see how this
evolves in time.  An analog of this test problem for diffusion of
energy is given in Swesty & Myra, ApJSS 181, 1-52 (2009) (SM).  The
thermal pulse is set at constant pressure.

We make use of an analytic solution (e.g. SM) to the 2D time-dependent
diffusion equation for a constant diffusion coefficient.  The initial
conditions are given as the Guassian pulse:

   T = T_0 * exp( -|r - r_0|^2 / (4 * D * t_0))

where T_0 is the peak temperature, r_0 is the location of the center
of the peak, D is the diffusion coefficient and t_0 is the time from
which the system is evolved.  The analytic solution is given by

  T(t) = T_0 * (t_0 / (t + t_0)) * exp( -|r - r_0|^2 / (4 * D * (t + t_0))).



OUTLINE:

  To solve this problem we take the following steps:

  1) initialize the state with the Gaussian pulse
  2) calculate the explicit conduction timestep
    
     we have an equation of the form:   d(rho*h) / dt = - D grad dot del T
     or dimensionally
	|(c_p * rho * T) / dt| = |-D * T / dx^2|
     so we get
        dt = (c_p * rho * dx^2) / D

     more formally we find the timestep to be half that given above.  this is 
     what we use in the timestep calculation and we find the minimum of such a
     value over the entire domain.

     this is compared with the previous timestep (dtold) and we take 
	dt = min(dt, dtold*max_dt_growth)

  3) build the coefficients used in the thermal_conduct routine
  4) conduct for the timestep determined in 2)
  5) update the temperature with a call to makeTfromRhoH
  6) copy the new data into the old data and repeat steps 2) - 5) until we 
     reach the maximum time.


ISSUES: these are probably all my faults but I cannot locate them

  1) The MG solver is calling a smoothing function at EVERY timestep, even 
     with the small initial (t0) stepsize.  After smoothing multiple times, 
     the solution usually converges until 2) below happens.

  2) The temperature profile begins to diffuse as one would expect until the
     Gaussian has expanded enough to reach the next computational box.  
     Something in the box boundary conditions isn't set correctly because the
     data is not properly filled; e.g.
