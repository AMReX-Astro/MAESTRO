A 3-d XRB on a uniform 384 x 384 x 768 grid run on Edison with the
Cray 8.2.6 compilers.

Three different domain decompositions were used:

64^3 grids:  6 x  6 x 12 = 432 grids
48^3 grids:  8 x  8 x 16 = 1024 grids
32^3 grids: 12 x 12 x 24 = 3456 grids

Three different modes of running were done:

MPI: one grid per MPI task, 24 MPI tasks per Edison node)

OMP6: 6 OpenMP threads per MPI task, 4 MPI tasks per Edison node,
      2 MPI tasks per NUMA node

OMP12: 12 OpenMP threads per MPI task, 2 MPI tasks per Edison node,
       1 MPI task per NUMA node.

All scripts also used the "-ss" 

We ran for 20 minutes or 100 steps, which ever came first.  Results are
averaged across all output using the scaling_avgs.sh script
