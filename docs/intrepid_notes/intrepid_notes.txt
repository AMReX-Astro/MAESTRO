The code should build correctly by calling:

    make HOST=intrepid

Currently, the best place to run a job is from the /gpfs1/user_name/ directory.
The compute nodes do not have access to the /scratch directory and therefore 
executables can not be run from there.

Each node on Intrepid contains 4 cores and 2 GB of memory.  There are 3 modes 
within which to run the code on a BG/P system: 1) SMP mode, 2) DUAL node mode, 
and 3) VN (Virutal Node) mode.  In SMP mode, each node is treated as a single
task which has access to the full 2 GB of memory and which can spawn 4 threads.
DUAL node mode treats each node as having 2 tasks, each with 1 GB of memory
and 2 threads.  VN mode treats each node as having 4 tasks, each with 512 MB of
memory and a single thread.  

NOTE that our code does not currently have directives for spawning threads and
as such VN mode would be best suited to our problems as long as they can fit 
within the 512 MB memory restriction.

Nodes are grouped together into partitions on a BG system.  On Intrepid, the
smallest partition has 64 nodes (256 cores, total).  All larger partitions 
are multiples of 2 of this smaller partition, i.e. 128, 256, 512, etc nodes.
Partitions can not be combined and the smallest parition which contains the 
number of requested nodes will be used.  For example, if the user wants to run
a 384 node job, a 512 node partition will be selected and the user will still
be charged for the 128 nodes that are sitting idle during the job.

Intrepid has 2 main queues for running jobs, a debug queue called "prod-devel"
and a production queue called "prod".  The debug queue has a maximum runtime
of 1 hour.  The production queue has a minimum partition size of 512 nodes.  
There are other queue types available, but I think they are for runs that have
requested a particular block of time directly from ANL.

Submitting a job is done via the following command:

 qsub -t <time> -n <num_nodes> -q <queue_name> [more options] \
      <name_of_executable> [executable's args.]

where <time> is the requested number of MINUTES of wallclock time, <num_nodes>
is the number of nodes, and <queue_name> is the name of the queue to run the
job in.  There are many [more options] but an important one is the 
"--mode <mode_type>" option; <mode_type> can be either "dual" or "vn".  
Omitting this option defaults to SMP mode.
