This directory will hold instructions on what is needed in order to 
call MESA modules from an outside program.

The instructions will deal primarily with the eos and net modules.

The main TeX file depends on a number of other Tex files which should be 
  located in the same directory. They include:
	appendix.tex
	compile_all_mods.tex
	hopper_compile.tex

	compile_one_mod.tex
	convert_short_names.tex
	setup_eos.tex
	setup_xmass.tex
	shutdown_eos.tex
