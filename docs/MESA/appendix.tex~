%\section{Mapping {\tt MAESTRO} to {\tt MESA}}
% \label{sec:code_mapping}
%
%Sample routines that can be used to setup the map between {\tt MAESTRO} 
%and {\tt MESA} data formats. {\tt chem\_get\_iso\_id} is a {\tt MESA} 
%function that takes an isotope name as its input and returns the index 
%of that isotope in the {\tt MESA} chemistry data table.

\section{Compilation Scripts}
 \label{sec:compile_scripts}

Useful script written in {\tt BASH} to help with compiling {\tt MESA} 
modules. The script cleans the module directory, compiles the source code and 
exports the libraries and {\tt .mod} files to the appropriate directories 
for every module.
