<p><h2>&lowast; Low Mach number variations</h2>


<p>There are several popular methods for filtering soundwaves,
which we summarize below.


<p><H3>Incompressible hydrodynamics</H3>

<p>The simplest low Mach number approximation is incompressible
hydrodynamics.  This approximation is formally the M &rarr; 0 limit of
the Navier-Stokes equations.  In incompressible hydrodynamics, the
velocity satisfies a constraint equation <div class="eq">&nabla;
&sdot; U = 0</div> which acts to instantaneously equilibrate the flow,
thereby filtering out soundwaves.

<p>The constraint equation implies that 
<div class="eq">D&rho;/Dt = 0</div>
which says that the density is constant along particle
paths.  This means that there are no compressibility effects modeled
in this approximation.


<p><H3>Anelastic hydrodynamics</H3>

<p>In the anelastic approximation small amplitude thermodynamic
perturbations are carried with respect to a hydrostatic background.
The density perturbation is ignored in the continuity equation,
resulting in a constraint equation 
<div class="eq">&nabla; &sdot; (&rho;<sub>0</sub>U) = 0</div> 
This properly captures the compressibility effects due to the
stratification of the background.  Because there is no evolution
equation for the perturbational density, approximations are made
to the buoyancy term in the momentum equation.


<p><H3>The low Mach number combustion model</H3>

<p>In the low Mach number combustion model, the pressure is decomposed
into a dynamic, &pi;, and thermodynamic component, p<sub>0</sub>, the
ratio of which is O(M<sup>2</sup>).  The total pressure is replaced
everywhere by the thermodynamic pressure, except in the momentum
equation.  This decouples the pressure and density and filters out the
sound waves.  <em>Large amplitude density and temperature fluctuations
are allowed</em>.  The only requirement is that the total pressure
stay close to the background pressure, which is assumed constant.
This requirement can be expressed as
<div class="eq">p = p<sub>0, </sub></div>
and
differentiating this along particle paths leads to a constraint on the
velocity field: 
<div class="eq">&nabla; &sdot; U = S</div>
This looks like the constraint for incompressible hydrodynamics, but
now we have a source term, S, representing the compressibility effects
due to the energy generation and thermal diffusion.  

<p>Since the background pressure is taken to be constant, we cannot
model flows that cover a large fraction of a pressure scale height.
However, this method is ideal for exploring the physics of flames.  We
formulated this algorithm for astrophysical flows and used it to
explore the dynamics of Rayleigh-Taylor unstable flame fronts in Type
Ia supernovae in two- and three-dimensions.  This was the predecessor
to Maestro.

<P><H3>The Maestro algorithm for low Mach number stellar flows</h3>

<p>To model the full star, we begin with the low Mach number combustion
model described above, but no longer assume that the background
pressure is constant, but instead, is hydrostatically stratified.
This results in a constraint on the velocity field of: 
<div class="eq">&nabla; &sdot; ( &beta;<sub>0</sub>U) = &beta;<sub>0</sub>[
S - 1/(&Gamma;<sub>1</sub>p<sub>0</sub>)
&part;p<sub>0</sub>/&part;t]</div> 

Here, &beta;<sub>0</sub> is a density-like variable.  Again, large
amplitude density and temperature variations are allowed.  The only
restriction is that the pressure remain close to the background
pressure.  In the presence of heating, the star will expand, and
therefore <em>we need to evolve the background state in response to
the local heating</em>.  This is an extension of the
pseudo-incompressible method introduced in the atmospheric science
community.  As with anelastic hydrodynamics, this constraint
incorporates the effects of the background stratification.  However,
in contrast to anelastic, the right-hand side is non-zero, and
represents the compressibility effects due to heating and the change
in the background state.
