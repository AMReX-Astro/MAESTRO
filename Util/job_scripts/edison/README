The process-edison.run script is used to postprocess plotfiles with
yt.  Note that the parallel-yt script actually calls the vol.py script,
and launches it with aprun, because otherwise it will not run on the
compute nodes.  This script will do multiple visualization jobs
in parallel on the compute nodes.
