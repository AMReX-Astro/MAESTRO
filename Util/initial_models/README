-- spherical
 
   generate an isentropic, self-gravitating WD model given a core
   temperature and density.
 
 
-- test2

   generate an isentropic plane-parallel atmosphere with an entropy
   jump below to surpress convective overshoot.  This is used by
   the test2 and test_convect problems.


-- toy_atm

   similar to he_burn.  An isentropic layer is placed on top of an
   isothermal base.  A jump in temperature at the base of the
   isentropic layer is specified, with a linear transition between the
   base and isentropic layer.  The isentropic layer is continued down
   until reaching a cutoff temperature, at which point the model is
   isothermal.
