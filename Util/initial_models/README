-- spherical

   generate an isentropic, self-gravitating WD model given a core
   temperature and density.


-- test2

   generate an isentropic plane-parallel atmosphere with an entropy
   jump below to surpress convective overshoot.  This is used by
   the test2 and test_convect problems.


-- toy_atm

   similar to he_burn.  An isentropic layer is placed on top of an
   isothermal base.  A jump in temperature at the base of the
   isentropic layer is specified, with a linear transition between the
   base and isentropic layer.  The isentropic layer is continued down
   until reaching a cutoff temperature, at which point the model is
   isothermal.


-- lagrangian_planar

   This takes an existing initial model that is unequally gridded
   (in space) and maps it onto a uniform grid and puts it in HSE
   using our equation of state.  At the moment, it assumes a
   constant gravitational acceleration and plane-parallel.  The
   integration is down (up and down) from the location of the
   peak T in the model, and the temperature profile of the initial
   model is preserved.


-- kepler_hybrid

   These were used for our original set of wdconvect calculations.
   They take a 1-d model from the Kepler stellar evolution code (which
   may not be uniformly spaced), and put it into HSE on the MAESTRO
   grid.  This particular version forces the inner region of the star
   to be completely isentropic.
