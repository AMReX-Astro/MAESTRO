Some notes on using OPENACC.

OLCF has a nice GPU guide:                https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/support/system-user-guides/accelerated-computing-guide/
And there are some Blue Waters resources: https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/openacc

Compile
==========

The BoxLib/Maestro build system already knows about OpenACC, so you just
need to set 'ACC := t' in your GNUMakefile.

Before compiling (with Cray), you will also want to load these modules:
PrgEnv-cray
craype-accel-nvidia35
cudatoolkit

(e.g. '$ module load craype-accel-nvidia35)

Run
========

In your batch script, be sure you request xk nodes (the ones with GPUs), similar to:
#PBS -l nodes=512:ppn=1:xk

To get some debugging output at runtime, you can set the environment variable CRAY_ACC_DEBUG
(I believe options are 1,2, or 3 with varying degrees of verbosity):
$ export CRAY_ACC_DEBUG=3
