This is intended to be an incremental, stable version of BDF that is fully 
Maestro-compatible and with some further vectorization, but no OpenACC
acceleration.  This is meant to debug and develop the vectorization itself
before moving on to acceleration. See dev/accelerated/README

Updates:
  7/29/2014:
   The fully vectorized and original, semi-vectorized BDF's appear to be giving results with 
   good agreement.  For larger dt they start to diverge a bit, which I would like to attribute
   to the semi-vectorized relying upon intermediate wrapper functions.  Should confirm.  Also,
   semi-vectorized goes a bit faster for large dt.
