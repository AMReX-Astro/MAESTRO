This is intended to be the minimum test (t1) that uses vbdf.  The orginal code,
bdf*, came with t1.  This version uses vbdf** with OpenACC to target
accelerating co-processors like GPUs.  It runs the same t1 problem on all CUDA
cores.

Useful env variables:
PGI_ACC_NOTIFY=1 
   May be set to 1-3, gives runtime info
PGI_ACC_TIME=1
   Gives timing info


TODO: Clean up output, make this into a usable unit test

*developed by Matthew Emmett while at LBNL
**what we call it in Maestro, ultimately we will explore any potential gains
of fully vectorizing the bdf code, hence vectorized bdf --> vbdf
