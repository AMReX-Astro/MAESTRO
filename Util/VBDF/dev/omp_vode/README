This is a reference version of the same test problem used to develop
the accelerated version of BDF.  I have it to make it easy to throw in debug prints
and to make apples-to-apples comparisons as much as possible with the accelerated
version of BDF.  In this reference, we use the default integrator VODE and OpenMP.
This establishes the baseline to compare all VBDF tests with.
