This directory contains source, tests, and examples for CCSE's vectorized,
variable step/order BDF implementation.  

The primary developer is Matthew Emmett of CCSE.
It was originally developed for CCSE's Combustion codebase.  The version found
here is adapted by Adam Jacobs of Stony Brook for use in solving the stiff ODEs of
Maestro's nuclear burning routines.  A novel feature of this integrator is
that it can evolve an arbitrary number of solutions in parallel (i.e. it's vectorized), 
making it ideal for targeting GPUs.

The original BDF code the source here is adapted from lives in 
Combustion/Chemistry/src_common/bdf.f90.  Please see test/t1.f90 for example usage.

NOTE: As of now Maestro only uses bdf.f90.  The other source files are from the Combustion
codebase and retained in case we decide to make use of them.
