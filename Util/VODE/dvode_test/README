This network is used as a regression test for the DVODE solver.  It models a
simple reaction network of the form:
      
                                  A <--> B

which has the following rate equations:

                   /     \   /              \   /     \
                d  | X_A |   | -alpha  beta |   | X_A |
              ---- |     | = |              | * |     |
               dt  | X_B |   |  alpha -beta |   | X_B |
                   \     /   \              /   \     /

where X_i is the mass fraction of species i and alpha and beta contain all the
information about cross-section, density, etc that would appear in a real 
reaction network.  This network does not care about any thermodynamics and it 
assumes the rates alpha and beta are constant in time.

This system has an analytic solution for the initial condition X_B(t=0) = 0:

           X_B             exp[(alpha + beta)t] - 1
          ----- = -------------------------------------------
           X_A     (beta / alpha) * exp[(alpha + beta)t] + 1

The system of equations in a realistic reaction network are usually very stiff.
The purpose of this test problem is to test how well DVODE handles solving a 
stiff set of equations.  As such, alpha and beta will be specified
parameters which, for a stiff system, should satisfy

                      |max(alpha, beta)|
                     -------------------- >> ONE
                      |min(alpha, beta)|

for real-valued alpha and beta.  It is not uncommon for this ratio to be in 
excess of 10^15 for a realistic network.  These values will be stored in the 
rates(:,:) array which is passed via the network module.

The tolerances for the DVODE solver are also set to be input parameters.  
This is important because DVODE calculates the overall error as:

               error(:) = rtol(:) * abs(X(:)) + atol(:)

where rtol and atol are the relative and absolute tolerances, respectively.  
The initial condition of the analytic solution could cause convergence issues
if atol were omitted.  Similarly if rtol were omitted, atol could be greater 
than the value of some early time composition and convergence would be a 
false-positive.  These values are stored in the tol(:) array, where 
atol(:) = tol(1) and rtol(:) = tol(2).
