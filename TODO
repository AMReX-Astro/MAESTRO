-- figure out what density_cutoff should be in initdata.f90 (in relation
   to anelastic_cutoff), and understand what values of this give a valid
   basestate expansion.

-- in modify_scal_force, for spherical, why don't we compute divu for
   the base state in the radial geom and then put it on the Cart grid,
   instead of putting w0 onto the Cart grid first and then computing
   div{U + w_0} together?  This is more along the lines of how we
   treat the div{w_0} stuff in update_vel.f90

-- should we be computing beta_0 differently for spherical?  In 
   particular, should we do linear reconstruction on g?

-- the small scale problem should read in its initial model in our
   standard format

-- are we handling the thermodynamics consistently when we hit small_temp?

-- in extern/helmeos/ we have a helmeos.f (used by MAESTRO) and
   helmeos.f90 (used by CASTRO).  We should remove helmeos.f

-- only need to keep one set of species names around in a network

-- need to add entropy to the gamma_law_general EOS

-- merge flame and flame_1d

-- In Maestro, initialize.f90, we have:
 
     ! check for proper nesting
     if (.not. ml_boxarray_properly_nested(mla%mba, 3, pmask)) then
        call bl_error('restart_grids not properly nested')
     end if
 
   the '3' is ng_s.  For ppm_type = 2, should this be 4?

-- add the ability in _parameters to check to make sure that runtime
   parameters are valid (e.g. cflfac should be <= 1).

-- add the ability to do an octant in the star.  Perhaps we need to
   expand the geometry types to include:

    o plane parallel
    o spherical
    o spherical_octant
    o planar 1/r**2 gravity

   the spherical octant will be useful for shell burning.  The planar
   1/r**2 gravity will be useful for the novae.

-- always force rho_0 = <rho> after initialization (not just if we
   do a perturbation) and recompute the corresponding p_0 -- this will
   ensure that we are in HSE at t = 0.
