-- figure out what density_cutoff should be in initdata.f90 (in relation
   to anelastic_cutoff), and understand what values of this give a valid
   basestate expansion.

-- in modify_scal_force, for spherical, why don't we compute divu for
   the base state in the radial geom and then put it on the Cart grid,
   instead of putting w0 onto the Cart grid first and then computing
   div{U + w_0} together?  This is more along the lines of how we
   treat the div{w_0} stuff in update_vel.f90

-- should we be computing beta_0 differently for spherical?  In 
   particular, should we do linear reconstruction on g?

-- the small scale problem should read in its initial model in our
   standard format

-- are we handling the thermodynamics consistently when we hit small_temp?

-- fix ppm boundary conditions for HOEXTRAP and EXT_DIR

-- in extern/helmeos/ we have a helmeos.f (used by MAESTRO) and
   helmeos.f90 (used by CASTRO).  We should remove helmeos.f

-- we use mac_multigrid in thermal_conduct.f90 to do the enthalpy diffusion,
   but mac_multigrid sets abs_eps based on the umac norm.  It should be
   generalized.

-- only need to keep one set of species names around in a network
