-- figure out what density_cutoff should be in initdata.f90 (in relation
   to anelastic_cutoff), and understand what values of this give a valid
   basestate expansion.

-- some places (like in rhoh_vs_t.f90), we loop over 1, nr(nlevs)-1
   when dealing with the base state, but in others, we loop over
   1, nr(n)-1 -- which should we be doing?

-- in modify_scal_force, for spherical, why do we compute divu for  
   the base state in the radial geom and then put it on the Cart 
   grid, instead of putting w0 onto the Cart grid first and then
   computing div{U + w_0} together?  This is more along the lines
   of how we treat the div{w_0} stuff in update_vel.f90

-- make firstdt do the divu estimator correctly for spherical

-- make_psi is called after scalar_advance, but we need psi in the
   enthalpy update for spherical, so we are using an old one -- this 
   is probably not consistent.

-- update Gconst to the latest accepted value

-- use the new w0mac stuff for estdt and makevort

-- should we be computing beta_0 differently for spherical?  In 
   particular, should we do linear reconstruction on g?

-- is enthalpy_pred_type = 1, it does not look like we are including
   psi in the final update -- this would only affect us if 
   evolve_base = T

-- We need something like an eta_rhoh that makes the base state
   enthalpy agree with the average of the full state enthalpy.

-- Re-examine the way we handle the dpdt_factor stuff, particularly
   the way we compute delta_p_term, now that we have a better
   handle on spherical fill and average
