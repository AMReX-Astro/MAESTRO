-- figure out what density_cutoff should be in initdata.f90 (in relation
   to anelastic_cutoff), and understand what values of this give a valid
   basestate expansion.

-- in modify_scal_force, for spherical, why do we compute divu for  
   the base state in the radial geom and then put it on the Cart 
   grid, instead of putting w0 onto the Cart grid first and then
   computing div{U + w_0} together?  This is more along the lines
   of how we treat the div{w_0} stuff in update_vel.f90

-- make firstdt do the divu estimator correctly for spherical

-- make_psi is called after scalar_advance, but we need psi in the
   enthalpy update for spherical, so we are using an old one -- this 
   is probably not consistent.

-- update Gconst to the latest accepted value

-- use the new w0mac stuff for estdt and makevort

-- should we be computing beta_0 differently for spherical?  In 
   particular, should we do linear reconstruction on g?

-- We need something like an eta_rhoh that makes the base state
   enthalpy agree with the average of the full state enthalpy.
