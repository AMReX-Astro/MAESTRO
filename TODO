-- put ppm into 1d edge state

-- figure out what density_cutoff should be in initdata.f90 (in relation
   to anelastic_cutoff), and understand what values of this give a valid
   basestate expansion.

-- in modify_scal_force, for spherical, why don't we compute divu for
   the base state in the radial geom and then put it on the Cart grid,
   instead of putting w0 onto the Cart grid first and then computing
   div{U + w_0} together?  This is more along the lines of how we
   treat the div{w_0} stuff in update_vel.f90

-- in mkscalforce, do thinks improve if we compute the div {U p0} term
   by creating a p0mac using the put_w0_on_edges routine, instead of
   putting the radial p0 onto a Cart, and then averaging it to the
   edges.

-- update Gconst to the latest accepted value

-- should we be computing beta_0 differently for spherical?  In 
   particular, should we do linear reconstruction on g?

-- the small scale problem should read in its initial model in our
   standard format

-- can we remove w0mac_interp_type = 0 (i.e. doing a MAC project to put
   w0 on edges?

-- are we handling the thermodynamics consistently when we hit small_temp?

-- the EOS should not take nspec as an argument -- this should come
   from the network module directly.
