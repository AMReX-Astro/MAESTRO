-- rebase the EOS to Frank's latest and turn on the Coulomb
   corrections.  

-- deal with the comment "! NOTE NOTE : THIS IS WRONG FOR SPHERICAL !!"
   in make_edge_state.f90.  Note that this same U.e_r dw_0/dr e_r term
   is missing from mkforce.f90 as well for spherical.

-- make a runtime diagnostic that prints <q> and q_rms for temperature,
   energy generation, and velocity as a function of radius.

-- figure out what density_cutoff should be in initdata.f90 (in relation
   to anelastic_cutoff), and understand what values of this give a valid
   basestate expansion.

-- fix restart for test_smallscale -- the inflow boundary is not set
   right at a restart

-- add the  w d(p0) / dz term into mkscalforce.f90 for the temperature
   equation.

-- make_w0 for spherical force not return the velocity force f,
   (1/rho0) grad pi_0

-- add the eta stuff in for spherical.
