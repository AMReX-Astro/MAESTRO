-- figure out what density_cutoff should be in initdata.f90 (in relation
   to anelastic_cutoff), and understand what values of this give a valid
   basestate expansion.

-- in modify_scal_force, for spherical, why do we compute divu for  
   the base state in the radial geom and then put it on the Cart 
   grid, instead of putting w0 onto the Cart grid first and then
   computing div{U + w_0} together?  This is more along the lines
   of how we treat the div{w_0} stuff in update_vel.f90

-- update Gconst to the latest accepted value

-- should we be computing beta_0 differently for spherical?  In 
   particular, should we do linear reconstruction on g?

-- If full_rhoh0_evolution=T, we need a correct_base and diffuse_base
   for enthalpy so the base state enthalpy agrees with the average of 
   the full state enthalpy.

-- the small scale problem should read in its initial model in our
   standard format
