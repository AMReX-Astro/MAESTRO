-- figure out what density_cutoff should be in initdata.f90 (in relation
   to anelastic_cutoff), and understand what values of this give a valid
   basestate expansion.

-- in modify_scal_force, for spherical, why don't we compute divu for
   the base state in the radial geom and then put it on the Cart grid,
   instead of putting w0 onto the Cart grid first and then computing
   div{U + w_0} together?  This is more along the lines of how we
   treat the div{w_0} stuff in update_vel.f90

-- update Gconst to the latest accepted value

-- should we be computing beta_0 differently for spherical?  In 
   particular, should we do linear reconstruction on g?

-- the small scale problem should read in its initial model in our
   standard format

-- are we handling the thermodynamics consistently when we hit small_temp?

-- the EOS should not take nspec as an argument -- this should come
   from the network module directly.

-- the new interpolation in average.f90 should be generalized for
   drdx_factor /= 5.

-- figure out how we want to implement ppm_type=2.  See MAESTRO/docs 
   at the end of section "Godunov notes" for details.

-- in extern/helmeos/ we have a helmeos.f (used by MAESTRO) and
   helmeos.f90 (used by CASTRO).  We should remove helmeos.f

-- rho_omegadot2, rho_Hnuc2, and thermal2 do not need to be regridded,
   since they are filled before they are used.  We can just delete the
   old and create an empty multifab with the new mla.

-- rho_omegadot2 and rho_Huc2 don't need to be stored in the checkpoint
   file anymore, since they are filled before they are used.

-- in regrid.f90, rw2 and rH2 have 1 ghostcell, but when they are originally
   allocated in initialize, they have 0

-- we use mac_multigrid in thermal_conduct.f90 to do the enthalpy diffusion,
   but mac_multigrid sets abs_eps based on the umac norm.  It should be
   generalized.
