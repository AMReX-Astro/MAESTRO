-- deal with the comment "! NOTE NOTE : THIS IS WRONG FOR SPHERICAL !!"
   in make_edge_scal.f90 (already implemented in make_edge_state.f90)

-- figure out what density_cutoff should be in initdata.f90 (in relation
   to anelastic_cutoff), and understand what values of this give a valid
   basestate expansion.

-- add the eta stuff in for spherical (also in the predictor)

-- some places (like in rhoh_vs_t.f90), we loop over 1, nr(nlevs)-1
   when dealing with the base state, but in others, we loop over
   1, nr(n)-1 -- which should we be doing?

-- in modify_scal_force, for spherical, why do we compute divu for  
   the base state in the radial geom and then put it on the Cart 
   grid, instead of putting w0 onto the Cart grid first and then
   computing div{U + w_0} together?  This is more along the lines
   of how we treat the div{w_0} stuff in update_vel.f90

-- generalize put_1d_array_on_cart in fill_3d.f90 to be able to 
   copy a 1D cell-centered or edge-centered array onto Cartesian edges

-- make firstdt do the divu estimator correctly for spherical

-- make_psi is called after scalar_advance, but we need psi in the
   enthalpy update for spherical, so we are using an old one -- this 
   is probably not consistent.
