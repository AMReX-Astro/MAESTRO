-- implement regression testing

-- rebase the EOS to Frank's latest and turn on the Coulomb
   corrections.  Also make it a module to enable compile-time
   argument checking

-- deal with the comment "! NOTE NOTE : THIS IS WRONG FOR SPHERICAL !!"
   in mkflux.f90

-- make a runtime diagnostic that prints <q> and q_rms for temperature,
   energy generation, and velocity as a function of radius.

-- figure out what density_cutoff should be in initdata.f90 (in relation
   to anelastic_cutoff), and understand what values of this give a valid
   basestate expansion.
