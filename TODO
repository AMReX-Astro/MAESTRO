-- rebase the EOS to Frank's latest and turn on the Coulomb
   corrections.  

-- deal with the comment "! NOTE NOTE : THIS IS WRONG FOR SPHERICAL !!"
   in make_edge_state.f90

-- make a runtime diagnostic that prints <q> and q_rms for temperature,
   energy generation, and velocity as a function of radius.

-- figure out what density_cutoff should be in initdata.f90 (in relation
   to anelastic_cutoff), and understand what values of this give a valid
   basestate expansion.

-- remove input_flag from the EOS module

-- change all use probin_module lines to have ONLY
