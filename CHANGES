changes since last merge with master:


17.08

 * Major changes:

  -- we now get the stellar conductivities from the Microphysics repo
     (part of StarKiller).  This is the same place as we get the
     general Helmholtz equation of state.

  -- the StarKiller-astro Microphysics repo now uses a denser table
     for the Helmholtz EOS (thanks to Frank Timmes).  If you are using
     this EOS, the new table will be soft-linked to your build
     directory automatically.  If you have an old copy laying around,
     it might fail to run, with an I/O error.


17.06

 * Major changes:

   -- we now use the reaction networks from the separate Microphysics
      git repo:

      https://github.com/BoxLib-Codes/Microphysics

      This is enabled by setting MICROPHYSICS_HOME to point to the
      location of the Microphysics/ directory.  Note: this is the same
      repo that is used for the general equations of state, so you
      likely already have it installed.

   -- we now require the AMReX library instead of BoxLib to build.


16.08

 * Major changes:

 * Minor changes:

   -- added runtime parameters for boxlib backtracing.  Now
      boxlib_fpe_invalid, boxlib_fpe_zero, and boxlib_fpe_overflow
      turn on/off FPE handling through the boxlib backtrace module

   -- Chosing the general Helmholtz stellar equation of state is now
      done with EOS_DIR := helmholtz, instead of helmeos.  This
      reflects the actual name of the directory in the Microphysics
      repo.


16.07

 * Major changes:

   -- For the general microphysics solvers, we now use the environment
      variable MICROPHYSICS_HOME instead of MICROPHYSICS_DIR.  The
      latter is deprecated and you will see a warning when building if
      this is set.  This change is to promote uniformity among the
      code bases.

 * Minor changes:

   -- The runtime parameter small_x is now owned by the network module.

   -- The conductivity_constant runtime parameter is now owned by
      Microphysics/conductivity/constant.

   -- If SYSTEM_BLAS is defined, we will attempt to link in a
      system-wide BLAS library (-lblas) rather than compiling the BLAS
      routines ourselves.

16.06

 * Major changes:

   -- We've switched over to the version of the Helmholtz stellar
      equation of state in the separate Microphysics/ repo.  This
      allows for code reuse with other BoxLib astro codes.

      Also with this change, the following EOS changes were inherited:

      * The minimum temperature allowable in the EOS is now a
        separately saved variable in the EOS structure and is strictly
        enforced by the limits of the interpolation table. The user
        can also specify small_temp/small_dens inside MAESTRO or
        CASTRO; if it is larger than that, it will be respected, but
        if smaller, you still cannot go lower than the lower end of
        the table. A similar statement applies for the maximum
        density/temperature.

      * The range of temperature is 10**3 K < T < 10**13 K and the
        range of density is 10**-12 g/cc < rho < 10**15 g/cc, which is
        wider than it used to be before.

      * The absolute values of the EOS quantities are also slightly
        different (at the ~1e-5 level) due to an update in the
        physical constants used to construct the table.

      * Previously, if the pressure was detected to be negative as a
        result of adding Coulomb corrections, all Coulomb corrections
        for all state variables were disabled. This trigger now also
        occurs if the energy goes negative.

      NOTE: this change means you now need the Microphysics repo
      (https://github.com/BoxLib-Codes/Microphysics) to use any
      equation of state other than the gamma-law EOS.

 * Minor changes:

   -- All inputs files have been switched over to use the string
      version of the boundary condition runtime parameters for clarity

   -- A workaround for a compiler bug in the Cray 8.4.x compilers was
      implemented, and these compilers are now supported
