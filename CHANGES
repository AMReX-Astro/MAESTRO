A list of changes to the code since paper III (i.e. future appendices)

-- added thermal conduction by setting use_thermal_diffusion=T

-- spherical base state expansion

-- predicting (rho h)' by setting enthalpy_pred_type=1

-- turning off evolution of h above atmosphere with do_eos_h_above_cutoff=T

-- created burning_cutoff_density, which is presently set to base_cutoff_density

-- volume discrepancy factor forcing term by setting dpdt_factor to a non-zero value

-- make T on edges from T=T(rho,X_k,p_0) by setting use_tfromp=T
