changes since last merge with master:

-- We've switched over to the version of the Helmholtz stellar
   equation of state in the separate Microphysics/ repo.  This
   allows for code reuse with other BoxLib astro codes.

   Also with this change, the follows EOS changes were inherited:

   * The minimum temperature allowable in the EOS is now a separately
     saved variable in the EOS structure and is strictly enforced by
     the limits of the interpolation table. The user can also specify
     small_temp/small_dens inside MAESTRO or CASTRO; if it is larger
     than that, it will be respected, but if smaller, you still cannot
     go lower than the lower end of the table. A similar statement
     applies for the maximum density/temperature.

   * The range of temperature is 10**3 K < T < 10**13 K and the range
     of density is 10**-12 g/cc < rho < 10**15 g/cc, which is wider
     than it used to be before.

   * The absolute values of the EOS quantities are also slightly
     different (at the ~1e-5 level) due to an update in the physical
     constants used to construct the table.

   * Previously, if the pressure was detected to be negative as a
     result of adding Coulomb corrections, all Coulomb corrections for
     all state variables were disabled. This trigger now also occurs
     if the energy goes negative.
