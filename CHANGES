A list of changes to the code since paper III (i.e. future appendices)

-- added thermal conduction by setting use_thermal_diffusion=T

-- spherical base state expansion

-- predicting (rho h)' by setting enthalpy_pred_type=1

-- turning off evolution of h above atmosphere with do_eos_h_above_cutoff=T

-- created burning_cutoff_density, which is presently set to base_cutoff_density

-- volume discrepancy factor forcing term by setting dpdt_factor to a non-zero value

-- make full state T on cell-centers after the advection-diffusion step from 
   T=T(rho,X_k,p_0) by setting use_tfromp=T for spherical problems

-- computing eta in spherical

-- flag full_rhoh0_evolution=F sets rhoh0 = Avg(rhoh) before advect base.  Subroutines 
   react_base and a (not-written-yet) correct_base for rhoh0 are not called
