changes since last merge with master:

 * Minor changes:

   -- The runtime parameter small_x is now owned by the network module.
   
   -- The conductivity_constant runtime parameter is now owned by
      Microphysics/conductivity/constant.

   -- If SYSTEM_BLAS is defined, we will attempt to link in a
      system-wide BLAS library (-lblas) rather than compiling the BLAS
      routines ourselves.


previous releases:

16.06

 * Major changes:

   -- We've switched over to the version of the Helmholtz stellar
      equation of state in the separate Microphysics/ repo.  This
      allows for code reuse with other BoxLib astro codes.

      Also with this change, the following EOS changes were inherited:

      * The minimum temperature allowable in the EOS is now a
        separately saved variable in the EOS structure and is strictly
        enforced by the limits of the interpolation table. The user
        can also specify small_temp/small_dens inside MAESTRO or
        CASTRO; if it is larger than that, it will be respected, but
        if smaller, you still cannot go lower than the lower end of
        the table. A similar statement applies for the maximum
        density/temperature.

      * The range of temperature is 10**3 K < T < 10**13 K and the
        range of density is 10**-12 g/cc < rho < 10**15 g/cc, which is
        wider than it used to be before.

      * The absolute values of the EOS quantities are also slightly
        different (at the ~1e-5 level) due to an update in the
        physical constants used to construct the table.

      * Previously, if the pressure was detected to be negative as a
        result of adding Coulomb corrections, all Coulomb corrections
        for all state variables were disabled. This trigger now also
        occurs if the energy goes negative.

      NOTE: this change means you now need the Microphysics repo
      (https://github.com/BoxLib-Codes/Microphysics) to use any
      equation of state other than the gamma-law EOS.

 * Minor changes:

   -- All inputs files have been switched over to use the string
      version of the boundary condition runtime parameters for clarity

   -- A workaround for a compiler bug in the Cray 8.4.x compilers was
      implemented, and these compilers are now supported
