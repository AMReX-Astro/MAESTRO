A list of changes to the code since paper III (i.e. future appendices)

-- added thermal conduction by setting use_thermal_diffusion=T

-- spherical base state expansion

-- predicting (rho h)' by setting enthalpy_pred_type=1

-- turning off evolution of h above atmosphere with do_eos_h_above_cutoff=T

-- created burning_cutoff_density, which is presently set to base_cutoff_density

-- volume discrepancy factor forcing term by setting dpdt_factor to a non-zero value

-- For spherical problems, make full state T on cell-centers after the 
   advection-diffusion step from T=T(rho,X_k,p_0) by setting use_tfromp=T rather
   than T=T(rho,h,X_k).

-- computing eta in spherical

-- flag full_rhoh0_evolution=F sets rhoh0 = Avg(rhoh) before advect base.  React-base
   will not be called.  If full_rhoh0_evolution=T, we need to write a correct_base
   and diffuse_base.

-- modified hyperbolics with use_new_godunov=T.  Papers I-III didn't give the gory
   details, which have changed, so newer papers may not have to either.

-- mkflux changes for putting rho and h on edges

-- changing enthalpy equation to have p div{U} instead of U grad{p} term
   in spherical

-- lag_etarho enables time-centering of eta and psi
