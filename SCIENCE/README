flame/

   A simple setup to model astrophysical thermonuclear flames.  This
   sets up a fuel and hot ash state in pressure equilibrium.
   Diffusion from the hot ash heats up the fuel igniting a flame.
   Inflow boundary conditions are used to keep the flame position
   (roughly) stationary.

   A special react_state in this problem averages the state laterally
   and calls the burner only on this 1-d average state.  Since the
   flame is (should be) laterially invariant, this is an optimization
   to speed things up.

   Currently this problem has issues with high densities (> 5.e7
   g/cc).  Reducing the CFL number (to 0.1) helps.  Experiments with
   the SNe code show that SDC can overcome these problems.


flame_1d/

   A pure 1-d version of the flame problem.  This can only be run with
   1 grid on 1 processor, since it uses a special version of the
   elliptic solve.
