flame/

   A simple setup to model astrophysical thermonuclear flames.  This
   sets up a fuel and hot ash state in pressure equilibrium.
   Diffusion from the hot ash heats up the fuel igniting a flame.
   Inflow boundary conditions are used to keep the flame position
   (roughly) stationary.

   A special react_state in this problem averages the state laterally
   and calls the burner only on this 1-d average state.  Since the
   flame is (should be) laterially invariant, this is an optimization
   to speed things up.

   Currently this problem has issues with high densities (> 5.e7
   g/cc).  Reducing the CFL number (to 0.1) helps.  Experiments with
   the SNe code show that SDC can overcome these problems.


flame_1d/

   A pure 1-d version of the flame problem.  This can only be run with
   1 grid on 1 processor, since it uses a special version of the
   elliptic solve.
  

H_core/

   Models H core convection in massive stars.  See Candace for details.


nova/

   Model novae -- H burning on the surface of white dwarfs.  See
   Brendan for details.


ns_ocean/

   See Chris for details.


o_shell/

   See Candace for details.


sub_chandra/

   sub-Chandrasehkar model for SNe Ia.  This puts an He envelope on the 
   surface of a white dwarf (using initial_models/sub_chandra/) and
   models the reactions via 3-alpha burning.  Still in a developmental
   state.  See Mike Z for details.


surface_waves/

   Simple problem to excite gravity waves.  See Mike Z for details.


toy_convect/

   A nova-like problem for studying convection.  This problem has seen
   extensive use in understanding which prediction types are the best
   when we have sharp species gradients.  See Mike Z or Ryan for
   details.


wdconvect/

   Model convection leading up to ignition in the Chandraseskhar-mass
   SNe Ia progenitor model.  This setup was the basis for Zingale et
   al. 2009 (ApJ, 704, 196), Zingale et al. 2011 (ApJ, 740, 8), and
   Nonaka et al. 2012 (ApJ, 745, 73).


xrb/

  The pure helium X-ray burst setup.  This was the basis for Malone
  et al. 2011 (ApJ, 728, 118) and Chris's thesis.


xrb_mixed/

  Mixed H/He X-ray bursts.  See Chris for details.


xrb_spread/

   A simple experiment in the accreted layer on a neutron star -- put
   in a hot spot and watch it spread away.
