changes to wdconvect runs for the next paper

-- use CFL = 0.7

-- change the diagnostics to only look at radial velocity inside the
   convective zone

-- turn on base state evolution

-- use PPM

-- use AMR

-- add 2% Keplerian rotation

-- in diag.f90, we normalize the mass with the coarse-level dx
   -- is this right for multilevel?

-- store the location of the peak temperature

-- store the total kinetic energy and the max velocity
