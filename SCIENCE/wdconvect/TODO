-- lower cutoff densities to 1.e5 -- this gets the base state expansion
   a lot better

   -- deal with higher velocities at the edge of the star through sponging.
      Make the factor over base_cutoff_density that the sponge starts at a
      runtime variable.

-- rotation runs at 1%, 2%, and 3%
