This problem sets up a cool fuel and hot ash state in pressure
equilibrium.  Thermal conduction will heat the fuel to the point of
ignition, and and flame will develop and propagate.  Inflow boundary
conditions on the fuel end feed in fuel at a specified rate.  This can
allow you to keep the flame stationary, but matching the inflow speed
to the laminar flame speed.
