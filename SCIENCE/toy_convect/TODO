initial model generated by initial_models/toy_atm using _params.nova
with the hotcno network

ideas to try for reducing the initial transient in the temperature
when starting a convecting simulation.

-- run for a while, resetting the full scalar state back to the 
   initial conditions after each call to advance.  This could build
   up a convective velocity field that matches the energy generation

-- as above, but only reset the base state.

-- run for a while to generate a convective velocity field, not resetting
   anything.

   Then start from 0, using the velocity field generated at the end of 
   the first pass, but the full initial conditions.
